# AI skills wired into this project

Three libraries in this stack ship official, actively-maintained agent skills
— all are installed project-locally so any teammate cloning the repo gets
the same guidance, not just this session:

- **shadcn** — installed at `.claude/skills/shadcn` (via `skills.sh`,
  `shadcn-ui/ui/skills/shadcn`). Covers correct component APIs, composition
  patterns, theming, and the CLI workflow. Loads automatically when working
  with `components.json` / shadcn components.
- **es-toolkit** — installed at `.claude/skills/{guide,migrate,recommend}`
  (via `skills.sh`, `toss/es-toolkit`). Covers API usage/import patterns, Lodash
  migration, and function recommendations. Official LLM documentation is also
  available at `https://es-toolkit.dev/llms-full.txt`.
- **TanStack Router** — wired via `AGENTS.md`'s `intent-skills` block
  (`@tanstack/intent`). Run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest list` to see
  available skills (auth guards, data loading, search params, type safety,
  etc.) and `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` to pull
  one in before touching routing code — the content is versioned against
  the installed package, so it won't go stale like memorized API knowledge.

No other library in this stack publishes an official skill as of this writing
— don't assume one exists just because it shows up as available in a given
session; that may just be a skill built into the coding agent itself, not
something this repo ships.

## es-toolkit skills: pruned `docs/`

`skills.sh --copy` vendors each es-toolkit skill's *entire* upstream
VitePress docs site (multi-locale pages, `.vitepress` build config, images,
etc.) — as installed, `guide`/`migrate`/`recommend` were ~13MB each and
100% identical to one another. Each `SKILL.md` only actually reads a
handful of files, so `docs/` in each of the three has been pruned down to
just that (see each `SKILL.md`'s `Workflow`/`Search local docs` section for
the current list — e.g. `usage.md`, `intro.md`, `bundle-size.md`,
`performance.md`, `reference/**`), bringing the three skills to ~1MB each.

Two things to know if you touch these again:

- **`bunx skills update` will re-bloat.** It re-copies the full upstream
  `docs/` tree, wiping this pruning. Re-run the prune (keep only the files
  each `SKILL.md` actually references) after any update.
- **A few `SKILL.md` references are already dead upstream**, independent of
  this pruning: `benchmarks/`, `src/{category}/*.ts` (strict) and
  `src/compat/{category}/*.ts` (compat), and `docs/compatibility.md` (the
  real file is `docs/compat/intro.md`, but `migrate/SKILL.md` names the
  wrong path). Not fixed here — restoring them would mean vendoring the
  library's full source tree, which reintroduces the bloat this cleanup
  removes. The skills still work without them; those steps just silently
  find nothing.
